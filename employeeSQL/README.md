# sql-challenge

The first part of the project involves Data Engineering- using quickdatabasediagrams.com to inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables. After identifying the primary and foreign keys, the connections between the tables are established and showed in the ERD. Then the schema is transferred to Postgres and upload all the CSV files in the new database- employees_db.

The "sql_challenge.sql" file contains all the steps of creating the tables in the "employees_db" and importing the data from the CSV files.
